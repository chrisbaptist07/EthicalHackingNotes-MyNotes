## üîí What is Cyber Security?

**Cyber Security** is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. It involves implementing technologies, processes, and controls to defend against cyber threats that aim to access, change, or destroy sensitive information, extort money from users, or interrupt normal business processes.

### Core Principles (CIA Triad):
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized individuals
- **Integrity**: Maintaining accuracy and completeness of data
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible when needed

---

## üîç What is Ethical Hacking?

**Ethical Hacking** (also known as Penetration Testing or White Hat Hacking) is the practice of intentionally probing systems, networks, and applications to find security vulnerabilities that malicious hackers could exploit.

### Key Principles:
- **Permission-based**: Always have explicit written authorization
- **Responsible disclosure**: Report vulnerabilities to the appropriate parties
- **No harm**: Don't cause damage or disruption
- **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of findings and methods

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Three Major Divisions of Cyber Security Teams

### 1. **Red Team** üî¥
- **Role**: Offensive security (Attackers)
- **Focus**: Simulating real-world attacks to find vulnerabilities
- **Activities**: Penetration testing, social engineering, exploit development
- **Skills**: Ethical hacking, vulnerability assessment, attack simulation
- **Goal**: Think like attackers to identify weaknesses before malicious hackers do

### 2. **Blue Team** üîµ
- **Role**: Defensive security (Defenders)
- **Focus**: Protecting, monitoring, and responding to security threats
- **Activities**: Security monitoring, incident response, threat hunting, forensics
- **Skills**: SIEM management, log analysis, incident handling, network defense
- **Goal**: Detect, prevent, and respond to security incidents

### 3. **Purple Team** üü£
- **Role**: Collaborative security (Bridge between Red and Blue)
- **Focus**: Combining offensive and defensive approaches
- **Activities**: Coordinating red/blue exercises, sharing threat intelligence, continuous improvement
- **Skills**: Both offensive and defensive techniques, communication, strategic planning
- **Goal**: Maximize security effectiveness through collaboration and knowledge sharing

## üë• Types of Hackers

### White Hat Hackers (Ethical Hackers)
- Work with permission to find and fix vulnerabilities
- Follow legal and ethical guidelines
- Help organizations improve security

### Black Hat Hackers (Malicious Hackers)
- Exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain
- Operate without permission
- May cause damage or steal data

### Grey Hat Hackers
- Fall between white and black hat
- May discover vulnerabilities without permission but don't exploit maliciously
- Often notify organizations about findings

### Red Hat Hackers
- Vigilante hackers who target black hat hackers
- Use aggressive methods to stop malicious activities
- Often work to take down black hat operations

### Script Kiddies
- Use existing tools and scripts created by others
- Limited technical knowledge and skills
- Often motivated by curiosity or showing off rather than malicious intent

### Hacktivists
- Hack for political or social causes
- Target organizations they oppose ideologically
- Examples: Anonymous, WikiLeaks operations

### State-Sponsored Hackers
- Government-backed cyber operatives
- Conduct cyber espionage and warfare
- Well-funded with advanced capabilities and resources

### Cyber Terrorists
- Use cyber attacks to cause fear and disruption
- Target critical infrastructure and essential services
- Motivated by ideological or political extremism

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Legal Requirements:
- **Written Authorization**: Always get explicit permission before testing
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly define what systems can be tested
- **Data Protection**: Respect privacy laws and regulations
- **Compliance**: Follow relevant standards (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

### Ethical Guidelines:
- Minimize impact on business operations
- Protect confidential information discovered
- Report all vulnerabilities found
- Don't access more data than necessary for testing

---

## üîß Common Tools and Concepts

### Reconnaissance Tools:
- **Nmap**: Network mapping and port scanning
- **Whois**: Domain information lookup
- **Google Dorking**: Using search engines for information gathering

### Vulnerability Assessment:
- **Nessus**: Vulnerability scanner
- **OpenVAS**: Open-source vulnerability assessment
- **Burp Suite**: Web application security testing

### Basic Networking Concepts:
- **TCP/IP**: Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol
- **Ports**: Communication endpoints (HTTP: 80, HTTPS: 443, SSH: 22)
- **DNS**: Domain Name System for translating domain names to IP addresses

---

## üéØ Attack Methodologies

### The Penetration Testing Process:
1. **Planning and Reconnaissance**
   - Define scope and goals
   - Gather information about target
   
2. **Scanning**
   - Identify live systems
   - Discover open ports and services
   
3. **Gaining Access**
   - Exploit vulnerabilities
   - Gain initial foothold
   
4. **Maintaining Access**
   - Establish persistent access
   - Escalate privileges if needed
   
5. **Clearing Tracks**
   - Remove evidence of the penetration test
   - Clean up any temporary files or logs
   - Document findings and provide remediation recommendations

---

## üåê Types of Cybersecurity Threats

- **Phishing**: Fraudulent communications designed to steal sensitive information like usernames, passwords, and credit card details

- **Ransomware**: Malicious software that encrypts victim's files and demands payment for decryption

- **Malware**: General term for malicious software including viruses, worms, trojans, and spyware

- **Social Engineering**: Psychological manipulation techniques used to trick people into divulging confidential information

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)**: Intercepting and potentially altering communications between two parties

- **Zero-Day Attack**: Exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities before patches are available

---

## üìñ Key Terminology

**Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system that can be exploited  
**Exploit**: Code or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability  
**Payload**: The actual malicious code delivered through an exploit  
**Zero-day**: Previously unknown vulnerability with no available patch  
**Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher-level access than initially obtained  
**Footprinting**: Gathering information about target systems  
**Enumeration**: Extracting detailed information about identified services
